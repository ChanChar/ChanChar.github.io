"It's a needed investment for my career", is what I keep telling myself when I decided to click "Confirm Purchase" on [apple.com](http://store.apple.com/us).
My current laptop (pre-mac era) is the [Asus T100ta](http://store.asus.com/us/item/201503AM040000011).

Don't get me wrong, I love the laptop regardless of its somewhat limiting RAM and the constant nagging when too many tabs are open on chrome
(if you have the same problem check out [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/). You can thank me later). It served it's purpose well. I wasn't expecting to
tackle a career in software/web development and was content with its capacity to handle Word and browsing the web. Another reason to buy another laptop
was that on my trip to San Francisco, this laptop was not able to connect to the wifi in certain areas. I later found
out that some places use a 802.11n 5Ghz network which my laptop didn't seem to support.
I'm not going to lie, I really liked the idea that it could double as a tablet but realized that I used it as one only a few times. I
most likely will continue to use it but for more entertainment and general Windows-only things but for now, this 10 inch tablet-laptop
needs to step aside for...my very first Macbook.

I have been saving a percentage of any money I received into a new laptop fund. I had enough to buy one for some time now
but I waited for Apple's Spring Forward presentation in case there were any changes I should know about.  After researching and scouring the web
for what seemed to be the "best" buy, the new retina macbook pro won me over. I am now patiently waiting for the 8gb 256ssd beautiful
laptop to be delivered. It seems to be the most appropriate when developing web apps and has the added benefit that MacOS is a *nix based
system. Goodbye to command prompt, hello to terminal.

## Project Crunch Time

Classes for Rmotr have ended but we still have one final project due in two weeks. The project can be about anything as long as it uses
an API, can be hosted on the web, and has some purpose to it. We're working in teams of three and basically have been thrown in the
deep end of web development. Since python was the language the course focused on, flask will be the framework to use. Its lightweight
base should a great starting point for our first web app. The group I'm currently in, hilariously named "Charlie's Angels," took the last
two days to plan out the game plan for our app. It was becoming increasingly clear how little we knew in terms of building an entire web app
but also reassuring when were able to somewhat easily pick up and understand all the different components that were needed. We have a running
list of "things to learn" which include topics like using bootstrap to get our frontend up and running (bootstrap-flask, in this case),
understanding how to use an ORM (SQLalchemy) since we only covered directly communicating with databases using SQL, and working with an API.

That seems to be a lot for three relatively new beginners but I'm enjoying the pressure of the time constraint and my teammates seem to
also be just as, if not more, eager to start. I believe that the whole working as a team dynamic added with the treading in unknown territory aspects of
building something are both required experiences for anyone in any field. It is significantly more helpful to understand how to work well
with others in reaching a common because it provides the needed feedback and helps to understand how others may learn. Needlessly to say,
I'm ready to bang this project out.

## What about Ruby?

I am continuing to review ruby and rails on a daily basis. There are lots of overlap in concepts when building a web app in rails and building
a web app in flask. Although flask isn't "MVCish" like rails, studying how to build a general web app in either framework can only served
to help. I also resumed working on challenge problems from various websites as needed practice. Reviewing data structures and algorithms
would need to be reviewed before my cohort starts.
