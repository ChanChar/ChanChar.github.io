Moved to blog from wordpress to Github's own pages with jekyll running in the background. I have not used markdown other than
creating docs for projects which means that this is going to be fun learning experience with lots of trial and error. Thankfully
jekyll's docs are pretty clear when it comes to formatting markdown and I found Daniel Grenfeld's
[MD guide](http://markdown-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basics.html). I may port over some of the previous published posts in
wordpress at a later time.

## Current Events
Over the last weeks, I've had the joy of being a student over at [Rmotr](http://rmotr.com/). We have two great mentors, Martin
and Santi(ago), who take time out of their lives to help motivated students learn beyond the basics of programming using python
and venture into web development using flask and django.

The program itself is relatively new and I believe we're the second batch of students that they have chosen to take in on their
dime to showcase the efficacy of the program. Although there may be a few things to improve, the time I have invested has only
proven to be extraordinarily beneficial in my personal understanding and development as a student. Since the program relies on an
online platform, the availability of help and access to other students and instructors is merely heading over to slack and typing
a question. It's exciting to be able to collaborate with those outside my own timezone and to be able be held accountable of my
progress by those in my group.

I'm hoping to write a better, much more thorough, review after completing the program and hope to emphasize the pros and cons then.

## The Countdown
It's also coming to the point where I should probably be reviewing the material for App Academy. I had the time to complete the
pre-work after receiving my acceptance letter (still excited about the email) but that was over a month ago. I think taking
the at least 1-2 hours a day reviewing the builtin modules (Enumerables, Arrays, Hashes, etc.), solving random problems on different
websites and skimming through a few chapters of Programming Ruby would work nicely as a refresher. Reviewing Rails is another whole
matter in of itself. I can say I understand the basics of MVC and why having that type of structure is important for applications in
general but I would not be able to say that I would be able to whip out some web app following all the rules if I was asked right now.
I wasn't expecting to just pick it up the ability to create large web apps but it would have been pretty awesome to have
matrix-level ability absorption. It would be impressive to fully understand any framework or language within a year alone.

I can dream.
