Rmotr was not just a class but also a collaboration between dedicated students and passionate mentors. The
program aimed to go beyond just teaching the fundamentals of programming using a popular programming
language, python, but provided the tools and environment so that newer developers would be well equipped to
dive into the world of web development. Due to the nature of the courseâ€™s speed, the first couple of weeks
were to ensure that all students were able to implement basic concepts such as conditionals, loops and simple
data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.). The following weeks dove into intermediate topics
including generators, decorators, comprehensions and object oriented programming (OOP).

Each topic was not just thoroughly discussed but put into practice in the form of easy and intermediate challenges.
In-session assignments were usually solved through group effort which in addition to providing the needed practice,
assured that all students were on the same page before moving on to the next task. I can admittedly say
that, initially, I had some difficulty with the concept of working on smaller problems as a group. Having
taught myself for the months prior, I was able to rush through most of the problems. However, taking the time
to discuss the problem as a group had taught me something that most technical books would never cover: how
to effectively communicate with a team. Through smaller sessions of group and pair programming, it was
evident that we all had slight variations in approaching the assignments. The mere act of verbally explaining the
mental steps that I took would lead to one of two benefits. It would either help another student better understand the
reasoning behind my approach or it would provide a window for discussion which almost always has led to a
better method in solving the task at hand. Either one of these outcomes were huge successes in my book.

The following weeks were then spent on further reviewing object oriented concepts (inheritance, abstract
classes, polymorphism, encapsulation) and taking the time to understand how a relational database
functioned. These two tasks were critical during the development of the web app. Instead of blindly using
an ORM, we would now be able to identify what commands were being initiated through SQLAlchemy methods.
Structuring the configuration file around object oriented design, we were able to reduce the repetitiveness
of the file but also make it easier to switch amongst the different environments (development, testing,
production). The benefits of writing clear and concise programs were becoming increasingly evident as the
project developed and grew.

As you may have guessed at this point, the last weeks were not class hangouts but geared towards diving
into web development. I want to point out that most of the students had very little to no experience
developing any type of web app. With the minimal supervision of the mentors, the students were set free to
devise, organize and create a Flask app by the end of a given deadline. To emulate a working environment,
groups would meet to discuss the scope of a given project, and to provide a proposal that outlined both the
features and purpose of the app. The project would span for a total of four weeks, where a part of each
week was spent in researching and building the app. Using Flask was an excellent framework to use for an
intro to web development because it required the developers/students to pull the individual components of the
web app together which forced us to recognize each part and taught the importance of reading through
documentation. At the end of the four weeks, Santi and Martin had organized a demo day in which professional
developers from various backgrounds provided well needed feedback of our completed apps. The developers
asked questions which felt akin to code reviews. There were many questions about testing that I personally
would keep in mind for my future projects.

By the final day of the program, I not only felt accomplished of what I have learned but more importantly
gained a small but close community of developers that I can collaborate with in the near future.
