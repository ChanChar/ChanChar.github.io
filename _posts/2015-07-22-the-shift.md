In the midst of interviews and applying, I've decided to do a redesign of my personal site. This blog was a great start since Jekyll makes it ridiculously easy to set up but I want something more customizable and slightly more organized. My next project is going to be my portfolio (blog, projects, etc.) built on Django and React.

Why I'm choosing Django:

Django is honestly a heavy tool for something that could be done in simply HTML/CSS but Django's app architecture will let me swap in and out different components of the site like the blog. It's also for me to incentivize learning more about Python's web frameworks beyond Flask.

Why I'm choosing React:

I've always been interested in UX/UI. Why make an awesome app look and feel shitty? It's wasted effort when you have an amazing backend but the display is off putting. React (and possibly Google's Material Design Lite) will provide an interface users can be amazed by. React also lets me branch out from my knowledge of Backbone into other frontend frameworks (why are there so many JS frameworks...).

It's going to take me a few weeks to come up to speed on Django and React but I'm going to make sure that I'm documenting the transition from Rails/Backbone to Django/React.

I'm feeling a mix between:
