# I'm in San Francisco.

I've finally made the moved in preparation for the first class next week at
[App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/). I'm currently sharing a small room with others but considering the long
hours that will be spent not sleeping, I'm sure I'll be fine with the lack of leg room. After getting to know
my roommates and learning about some of the culture in SF, one thing was very clear:

**There's an app for everything.**

I read this [Medium post](https://medium.com/matter/the-shut-in-economy-ec3ec1294816) titled, "The Shut-in Economy"
prior to moving to SF and didn't understand the prevalence of these "personal service" businesses and apps.
I casually mentioned, to my all so helpful roommates, that I was slightly worried about not having a solid form
of transportation which was met a quick reply, "What do you need?". I listed out how I would need to buy groceries, room supplies,
caffeine, etc. He shot back with a quick list of apps and how they would solve all my problems and I have to say,
they really did solve every problem I had. Apps like [Google Express](https://www.google.com/shopping/express/) and
[Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/store) would deliver groceries from major stores right to my door! If that
isn't the definition of convenience, I don't know what is. Transportation was covered by popular services like
[Uber](https://www.uber.com/) and [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) if I ever needed to get anywhere that a
[BART](https://www.bart.gov/) station wasn't already close enough to. As for coffee, simply walking down the street
would yield four to five cafes/coffee shops. Coming from the humble town of Cerritos, I have to admit, SF has a level
of accessibility and higher number of these personal services beyond anywhere I've been to before.
It's an entire world on its own!

However for that level of accessibility, there is a significantly higher cost of living. The prices for food is
steeper, rent is not a joke, and the costs of public transportation do add up. As a recent college graduate,
my pockets aren't exactly brimmed but I believe with my budget I should be able to get by. Things like not buying meals
from restaurants or using services like [SpoonRocket](https://www.spoonrocket.com/) but cooking my own meals are going
to help a lot. Everything is in walking distance, so I'm not worried about transportation but the occasional
trip shouldn't hurt the bank either. Being mindful of the amount I'm spending and sticking to a budget is
something I'm constantly worried about and obviously, there was an app for that. I've been using [Mint](https://www.mint.com/)'s
services to keep track of my spending but its starting to shine with budgeting. Anyhow, enough with apps.

Having some downtime, I wanted to stay as active as possible so after settling in I decided to attend a meetup.
My second afternoon spent in the city was at one of [Flask Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/The-San-Francisco-Flask-Meetup-Group/events/221660069/)'s
events. The event was sponsored by both Wakatime, the hosts of the group, and Zerocater, who were awesome enough to lend us their
office and provide food for the event. Roughly 40 people, consisting of developers, students and tech writers,
attended to socialize and listen to the talk on various Flask related topics. They presented on things like
differentiating between Flask and Django, how to use AWS-Beanstalk and Docker to scale a Flask app, and finished
with a talk about growing a business. I felt the talks were geared towards learning students that have never heard
of Flask in that the topics covered were more general overviews and not technical lessons. Having fun talking
to others in the area (where a surprising amount of people were from the LA area), enjoying the food and talks,
I plan to definitely attend more.

The next topic could be a post all on its own but teaming up with Rmotr's mentors, a previous teammate, Alan, and
another student, Will, we decided to create a Django app that would help the future classes at Rmotr. The project
will be a web app that will help organize the various operations at Rmotr including setting up assignments/homework,
centralizing student information, and processing student enrollment/assessments. Only a rough outline of use
cases have been set but with the help of [Trello](https://trello.com/b/dLUvwghR/rmotr-sis) and we're all picking at different aspects to work on which
will integrate into one larger project. Django having it's project and apps separate so that each app handles
one main functionality, it's relatively easy to organize this particular project with its many components.
Although unsure of the time that App Academy is going to require of me post class hours, I'm hoping to be a major
contributor of this project because of how useful it's going to be for the instructors and for any future
students that want to learn Python through this class. **If it's a platform to provide education, I am all for it**.
Using Django should be a blast and I'm excited to pick up concepts along the way.

4/18 Update: Google Express is pretty awesome. Items from four different stores delivered to my front
door + an awesome chat with the delivery guy about his trip to Disney back when he visited LA.
