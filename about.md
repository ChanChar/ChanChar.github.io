### Hey, I'm Charlie (or Charles, Chuck, Chan).

I am a web developer who mainly works primarily with Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js. My past projects have been built using Rails, Backbone, or Flask (and also HTML, CSS). If you want to collaborate on an awesome project, feel free to reach out!

### Purpose

I decided to write this year as an exercise in visualizing and writing down my thoughts. This blog serves as a collection of events, reminders and lessons that I would like to keep a record of. It may also double as a platform for me to display any projects that I build.
