The MVP for my portfolio is up. It's more of a static page to display my projects for now. You can visit it at [charleschanlee.me](http://charleschanlee.me).

Originally my plan was to build it in Django + React, but now I've ended up building it with Rails + React. Getting a functional website up as quickly as possible was one of my first goals. By having to separately learn Django and React while also trying to learn how to use them together, I felt that progress was slow.

The running list of features that I hope to implement can be seen on the [README.md](https://github.com/ChanChar/TheCharlie).
The main goals are to have a visible online portfolio, gather a bit of information about how people interact with the site, and to continually update it over time.

It looks a bit bare, albeit clean. Most of the time was spent learning React followed by 2-3 days of actually working on the site itself. Future updates to come!
