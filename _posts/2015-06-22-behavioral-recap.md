We have today off since the new class is starting today. Having talked to a few of the incoming students, their excitement, nervousness and eagerness were all reminiscent of how I felt on my first day. Although it hasn't been long in terms of days, the amount of material I've covered does feel significant to the point where I do feel like a software developer. This capstone project felt reasonably challenging where I was allowed to exercise creativity without violating any of the good practices I've picked up. Given almost a full two weeks to build an app from the ground up is not an easy task. In addition, the time constraint has helped to understand time estimations for specific features. For example, building a simple auth system took a couple hours. I feel that I could build a similar one within a consistent range of time.

However, simply memorizing components is going to be detrimental in the long run when I hit a problem that requires me to critically analyze and solve. Being a web developer that recycles the same parts is not something I aspire to be.

I can answer the question of 'Am I a software developer?' with a firm yes. Am I the best developer, not by a long shot but I feel a sense of affirmation that I do want to dedicate my life within this field. This experience so far has been simply one of the few steps that I've taken towards becoming a better developer.

In other news, I've organized a small trip to a nearby Korean BBQ restaurant later this afternoon for a small group of classmates. It should be a nice breather before diving into the last phase of the program.

I can already imagine applying to various companies with the hope of earning the title as a software developer.
This is going to be fun.
