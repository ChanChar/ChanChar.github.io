Here's a short list of pros and cons of attending tech meetups/conferences.

# Pros
**One of the best places to meet other developers, aspiring developers, students, etc.**

A meetup's size can range from a small handful of people sitting around a round table at an office enjoying pizza
and coffee to thousands of individuals walking about on a campus in the search for another presentation/talk. I personally
like the smaller varieties of meetups where by the end of the day you know each person by name, have an understanding of
where they're coming from and feel comfortable sharing jokes in between presentations. I've had the chance to talk to
professionals from including sys admins, web devs, mobile devs, business heads, and product evangelists. One thing was
clear in most of these individuals, they're passionate about what they're doing and hearing about what they're working on
only serves to further encourage me to pursue mine.

**Learn, learn, learn**

The diversity and amount of content from each meetup has never failed to introduce something new. I have been to talks
that discussed the inner workings of a large cloud platform to more non-technical talks about the developer's lifestyle.
I'm constantly enamored when a speaker is able to break down an absolutely complex idea down and present that to a captivated
audience, experienced or not. Now listening to a talk hasn't made me a professional in any way but it has
significantly sped up my learning process of some of the different elements of programming and problem solving.

# Cons
**Confusing topics and talks**

Sometimes a talk is just outside my current understanding of a specific topic. One talk was about continuous integration;
at the time I remember I was just covering general MVC and this talk about how Jenkins was used within their app was
outside my depth. I understood maybe 25% of what they were talking about but I made sure to write a quick note to see
if I would be able to find some description when I got back home. It's not much of a con in the long run but it does feel
like one when you're sitting there with the speaker's words goign right over your head.

**Costs**

This is a con geared towards some of the larger conferences. It's not cheap to travel or attend some of the larger
conferences that were available. For some individuals, their company funds their trip but for many lone individuals,
out of pocket may be the only way.

# Conclusion

It's has always been a beneficial experience for me. They're a clear reminder of how little I know in the grand scheme of things
but attending friendly engaging talks are always welcomed. There were disproportionately many more talks that I have enjoyed
compared to those I haven't. I have had the chance to talk to professionals in many different fields, touch on a countless
number of topics and have thoroughly enjoyed my time at each meetup.

Also, no one can deny that the pizza is always somehow better.
